# Exam Instances
## External Candidates Exam Scheduling problem.
Twice a year, the regional school departments in Norway need to schedule
exam sessions for external candidates in region, which also involves 
reserving and assigning rooms, examiners and reviewers.
This repository contains five real-life instances solved for 
the Department of Education of Vestfold County, 
a large region including Oslo. 
The instances correspond to five successive exam periods.
The instances accompanies the paper _A cut-and-branch algorithm for the External
Candidates Exam Scheduling problem_ by Pasquale Avella (avella@unisannio.it),
Maurizio Boccia (maurizio.boccia@unina.it), Carlo Mannino (carlo.mannino@sintef.no), 
Michele Mele (michele.mele1991@gmail.com) and Sandro Viglione (sviglion@vitec.it).
